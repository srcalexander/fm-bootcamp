            Led by Dogs Trust in collaboration with researchers from the University of Leeds and the University of Exeter, the research
            combined data from a breed registry, vet organisations, pet insurance companies, an academic institution and animal welfare
            charities in a UK-first to reach a more accurate number. Accounting for the UK's dog population could help those involved in dog
            welfare to plan for future canine care needs and pinpoint areas of focus. Telford was revealed as the top dog hotspot in the
            country, with 8.2 dogs per 20 people. Harrogate had the joint-third highest ratio in the country with 7.4 dogs per 20 people.
            The lowest densities of dogs were reported for six areas of London, covering postcode areas N, E, SW, WC, W and UB, with
            approximately one dog for every 20 people. The researchers used data from 2019 to complete their first estimate, but this new
            approach puts a framework in place so they can track the dog population over time, making data available about the popularity of
            specific breeds and dog hotspots. Dr David Wong, Associate Professor of Health Data Science and Health Informatics at the
            University of Leeds School of Medicine, was an author on the study. He said: “This groundbreaking study sheds new light on the
            UK's dog population and density. Supporting the research team to develop a better understanding of our canine companions has
            been an incredibly rewarding experience. Dogs Trust have excelled in bringing together a diverse range of stakeholders and
            experts to deliver insights that will underpin research for many years to come.” Dr Kirsten McMillan, Deputy Head of Research at
            Dogs Trust and lead author, said: “The UK is well known for being a nation of dog lovers, but it turns out we may have
            significantly underestimated how many dogs are out there by over four million! This inaccuracy can have serious implications as
            it affects important statistics like how many dogs of different breeds or sizes live in certain regions, how the dog population
            grows each year, and the overall trends in dog ownership. “This new study is the most comprehensive analysis of the dog
            population in the UK to date.

            It's packed with valuable insights for everyone involved in dog welfare and our friends within the welfare sector, veterinary
            care, epidemiological, and business fields. With plans to replicate this study in the future, we'll be able to track changes in
            dog populations over time, helping us better understand the changing population, including breed popularity and its impact on
            welfare. “It's been fascinating to uncover stark differences in dog density throughout the UK, with Telford and Darlington
            emerging as leaders, boasting the highest dog-to-human ratios. These and future statistics provide valuable insights into
            regional trends and the dynamics of pet ownership across the country.” Dr Xavier Harrison, Senior Lecturer at the University of
            Exeter, said: “Knowing how many dogs there are in the UK is important, but isn't necessarily straightforward to calculate. Up to
            date estimates of the size and distribution of the dog population within the UK, and how these trends vary by breed and age,
            allow us to highlight where and why certain breeds are more popular. More importantly, they provide a solid baseline for
            investigating what factors that may drive changes in dog ownership in the future, with consequences for human and pet health.”

            population in 2019 was published in Nature Scientific Reports. Data sources included a breed registry (45.0%: The Kennel Club
            (KC), UK), veterinary corporations (26.5%: PDSA; Medivet; Vets4Pets), pet insurance companies (17.1%: The Insurance Emporium
            (The Equine and Livestock Insurance Company Limited); NCI Insurance; Cardif Pinnacle; Agria Pet Insurance; Direct Line), animal
            welfare charities (5.9%: Battersea Dogs and Cats Home; Blue Cross; SSPCA; Raystede; Wood Green, The Animals Charity; Edinburgh

            Michael Scott began his career at Dunder Mifflin as a salesman under Ed Truck. He later replaced him, likely while Randall was
            CFO pre 2005, and served as Regional Manager until 2008 (late Season 5) when he founded the Michael Scott Paper Company with Pam
            Beesly and Ryan Howard. Shortly after, he was reinstated as Regional Manager after his company was bought-out by Dunder Mifflin.
            He briefly served as co-manager with Jim Halpert until his demotion to salesman following the merger with Sabre in 2009. This
            decision was later reversed, where Scott served his remaining tenure until 2011 (late Season 7) when he relocated to Colorado
            with Holly Flax. Casting Steve Carell Steve Carell portrays Michael Scott. All original series characters were adapted for the
            U.S. version. NBC programmer Tracy McLaughlin suggested Paul Giamatti to producer Ben Silverman for the role of Michael Scott,
            but the actor declined. Martin Short, Hank Azaria, and Bob Odenkirk were also reported to be interested.[2] In January 2004,
            Variety reported Steve Carell of the popular Comedy Central program The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, was in talks to play the
            role. At the time, he was already committed to another NBC mid-season replacement comedy, Come to Papa.[3] Due to Carell being
            unavailable, Bob Odenkirk was selected as Michael Scott and was part of the cast presented to NBC executives.[4] However, Come
            to Papa was quickly canceled, allowing Carell to commit to The Office. Carell later stated he had only seen about half of the
            original pilot episode of the British series before he auditioned. He did not continue watching for fear that he would start
            copying Gervais' characterizations. On the audio commentary of the pilot episode, director Ken Kwapis says that Carell's
            unfamiliarity with the British version of The Office and their experience working together on Watching Ellie influenced him
            being cast as Scott.[5]
